YouTube Data Harvesting & Warehousing Using SQL

Domain: Social Media

In this project, I developed a comprehensive solution to harvest, store, and analyze YouTube data. Leveraging Python scripting and API integration, I built a user-friendly interface with Streamlit to dynamically display processed data.

Step-by-Step Process:

Data Collection: Utilized the YouTube API to retrieve various data points including channel information, video details, playlists, and comments.

Data Storage: Transformed the retrieved YouTube data into pandas dataframes, created corresponding SQL tables, and used SQL scripts to insert the collected data into a SQL database, functioning as a data warehouse.

Data Analysis: Developed a Streamlit application to interact with the SQL database, enabling dynamic display and analysis of the harvested data.

Skill Takeaways: 

Python scripting, data collection, API integration, data management using SQL, and creating interactive applications with Streamlit.
